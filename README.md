#  Government policy evaluation on consecutive holidays: traffic flow of Taiwanese highways

This study examines the Taiwanese highway traffic behavior on consecutive holidays. 
This investigation is essential for evaluating the Taiwanese freeway bureau's traffic control and management strategies. 
For this reason, a real-time prediction-based detection method is proposed for finding highway traffic anomalies using reconciled ordinary least squares (OLS) 
forecasts and bootstrapped prediction intervals. Two fundamental features of traffic flow time series, seasonality and spatial autocorrelation are captured by adding 
Fourier terms in OLS models, spatial aggregation, and reconciliation step. Our OLS approach is a simple method that models complex traffic datasets with reasonable 
accuracy while avoiding the computational problem. Our dataset includes hourly time series of Taiwan's consecutive holidays in 2019, 2020, 
and 2021 (73 days - 1752 hours). Our time series is the number of vehicles collected by the Electronic Tolling Collection (ETC) system on three main highways. 
Our results show that the number of anomalies in the north direction is higher in central Taiwan on highways No. 
1 and 3, while in the south direction, it is higher in the southern area on highway No. 3. 
In contrast, the east and west directions, elevated No.1 highway, show fewer anomalies.
